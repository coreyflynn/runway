# runway
framework for generating styleguide pages based on sass and polymer components

## how do I run this thing?
runway is an express app running on node.js. If you don't have [node](https://nodejs.org/) installed, go ahead and do that now.
Once you've got node.js, just clone the repo and then run

    npm install
    node app.js
