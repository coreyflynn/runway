sg-section(name='Blockquote')
  blockquote
    p.
      The blockquote element is used to indicate the quotation of a large section 
      of text from another source. Using the default HTML styling of most web 
      browsers, it will indent the right and left margins both on the display and 
      in printed form, but this may be overridden by Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
